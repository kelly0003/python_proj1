# python_proj1

This is a console-based Hangman game written in Python, where players guess letters in a hidden word, and the game visualizes the progress using a "hangman" image for each incorrect guess. Below a summary of how the game operates. 

Python Programming Language: The entire game is built using Python, which is well suited for console-based text games. It allows for easy manipulation of data structures. 

Game Summary: 
    The objective of the game is for the player to correctly guess the hidden word (from a chosen category and difficulty level) by entering one letter at a time. For each incorrect guess, a part of a hangman 
    figure is drawn. If the figure is fully drawn before the word is guessed, the player loses. If the player guesses all the letters in the word, they win.
